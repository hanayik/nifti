## Organization

`nifti` is a library. It is intended to be used in _your_ code so that you can read and write nifti files.

There are some binary executables that can be built though. These are in the **cmd** directory.

The only executables that can be built are in the `Makefile`. These are mainly for testing, and may be removed in the futre.
